# i3-gaps-deb
Tool to create and install Debian packages of _i3-gaps_.

## How does it work?
It uses the newest stuff from [here](https://github.com/Airblader/i3),
makes some modifications (only if necessary for the _building step_)
and finally produces common Debian packages.

## What's the purpose?
_i3-gaps_ simply does not exist in Debian (so far).

## How do I use it?
    $ git clone git@github.com:maestrogerardo/i3-gaps-deb.git
    $ cd i3-gaps-deb
    $ ./i3-gaps-deb
    $ # Follow the interactive prompts.

## Works for what?
  - Debian "stable" _and later_.
  - Everything derived from above (e.g. Ubuntu).

## Credits
Thanks to [stapelberg](https://github.com/stapelberg) for creating
[i3](http://i3wm.org/) and [Airblader](https://github.com/Airblader)
for the _gaps part_  (...and of course to _anyone else_ contributing to _i3_).

Hey, I'm [thirsty](http://gunbomber.org/donation.html) like hell... _;-)_
